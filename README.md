I spend too much of my time fiddling with OpenComputers. Sometimes I make
things that other people would find useful. Here are most of them.

Packages
========

redfs
-----

Fake filesystem exposing access to Redstone cards/blocks with a `/proc`-like
interface.

Usage:

    mount.redfs /mountpoint

This is provided in the hope that it will be useful, either as given or as a
basis for other custom filesystems.
